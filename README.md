# ImageAnalysisCourse2023
Materials for the image analysis course at Huazhong Agricultural University in 2023. This course includes lectures on basic knowledge and hands-on training, and is intended for graduate students in the field of life sciences who have little experience in image processing and image analysis. By following the lecture slides in PDF, you will be able to practice the basics of image processing and analysis using ImageJ/Fiji and Python. Although the materials are open to the public, they are designed to be used in the hands-on course with an instructor, so they may not provide sufficient information on their own. Free to use for non-commercial educational/training purposes. I am publishing these in the hope that they will be of use to someone, but due to limited resources I am unable to provide much support.
Among the files used in the course, the following files are available in this repository.
-	TIFF image files (“HeLa_Hoechst_GM130_CENP-F”)
-	Hoechst_mean.csv
-	Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files
-	tutorial.yaml
The original of the TIFF image files is in this Zenodo repository (Nagao et al., MBoC, 2020): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3825945
